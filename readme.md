# Comparing Arrays

## Step 1
Examine and run the code to see how it functions. Change the value of one of the elements in  the **secondArray**.  How does the output of the program change?

Add a comment to the code each time an array is used, describing what that line of code is doing. Also add comments each time the **arraysEqual** variable is used, describing what that line of code is doing.  You should have at least **7** comments added.

## Step 2
Modify the code, now allowing the user to enter in each of the 5 elements for firstArray and secondArray from the keyboard.

## Step 3
Now modify the code so that the user will first input the number of integers to be read. Assume there will be no more than 50 integers for each array.
